Easily enable and customize Font Awesome for your Divi Builder powered WordPress site. (Supports the Divi Builder plugin and the themes Divi and Extra.)

== Description ==
With this plugin you will be able to use Font Awesome - the iconic font and CSS toolkit on your Divi Builder powered WordPress site. Supports the Divi Builder plugin and the themes Divi and Extra.
No programming needed, just activate, paste in your Font Awesome embed code and you are ready to go.
You can easily customize the look and feel of lists based on your needs without any CSS coding.
The plugin does not (yet) provide a UI for inserting icons into your content. To see how you can use specific fonts, please refer to the <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/" target="_blank">Examples page</a> of Font Awesome.
Note: The plugin was specifically created for use with the Divi Builder plugin, or the themes Divi and Extra (from Elegant Themes). Using a child theme is highly recommended.
